# Immediate Follow-Up Tasks

- Integrate a persistent graph store with selection and editing actions (move, delete, connect).
- Flesh out the AssemblyScript emitter with real node scheduling and buffer allocation.
- Wrap the AssemblyScript compiler in a Worker and add incremental rebuild hooks.
- Implement SharedArrayBuffer-backed parameter/event rings between UI and Worklet.
- Replace toolbar compile/run placeholders with proper audio context lifecycle management.
